## 🤓 Projects 

I'm a strong believer in side projects, and have always liked to do my own projects in my sparetime. I think it's a great way for learning new technologies, and expand your skills.

**Side-project I maintain:**
- [Profesionalmente.com.gt](https://profesionalmente.com.gt)
- [Hundeskoven.dk](https://hundeskoven.dk) 
- [Efterlyshund.dk](https://efterlyshund.dk) 

All my side-project are done through my Company, [Websnack](https://github.com/websnack-dk). (Mainly focused on my own side-projects).
